    <h1>Portfolio</h1>
    <p> Iam very interested in The Technical Support Specialist position. I believe my experience, training and proven ability as a well-rounded IT Tech Official will allow me to significantly contribute to the productivity and quality of your company's IT Department.
         If you are seeking an IT Professional who has problem-solving skills and can easily provided optimum support to your operations, then please consider what I have to offer.
         Throughout my career I have garnered many technical skills, specifically in the IT field. Although IT has been my academic pursuit in the past, TBC gave me the opportunity to develop my career in various capacities that weren’t always IT related. Thankfully, I was given the opportunity to be exposed to the sales industry where I thrived thanks to my hunger and desire to learn how to succeed in such a business that rewards you for the amount of effort you put in.
         Within my 1st three months with TBC I worked as a Customer Sales Advisor, averaging roughly $12,000 in gross profit per week. I also managed to increase sales for the three consecutive months and hit 3 out the 5 monthly budget goals which allowed myself and the other store associates to obtain our monthly bonuses. While IT may be my technical strength, my ambition as well as my work ethic is what really makes me an asset.  I am professional and approachable in my interactions with customers and colleagues. 
         In my previous role I had the opportunity to work collaboratively with many different departments, driving my need to be adaptable and marketable.
         I find strength in diversity and I bring tolerance and innovation to the teams that I am a part of, and I am comfortable assuming a leadership role.  However, I would be none of these things without my developed listening skills and ability to be coached.  I am aware of a persons’ need to be heard, and I take the time to listen and take heed, and this truly sets me apart.
